## Last Verse
Always and forever is so far away,   
But know I'll stand by you for every last day,   

Your beauty shines like a warming ray  
That keeps me from ever falling astray,   

Our love is strong and here to stay.  
Hold onto us and we'll find a new way,   

One that won't have any gray,   
Only love that will never fray...   

Always and forever, Baby
